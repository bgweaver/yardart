# Yard Art Website

Welcome to the Yard Art website repository! This project represents my very first attempt at building a website entirely on my own. The inspiration for this site came from noticing a local business with a poorly designed website. I took it upon myself to create a more appealing and user-friendly version, although the business ultimately did not implement my design.

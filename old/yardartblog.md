# From First Draft to Polished Product: The Yard Art Website Redesign

When I first built the Yard Art website, I was still getting my feet wet with Bootstrap and web design in general. The original code (seen [here](https://www.ayardart.com) if you want to peek) was functional but rough around the edges. It got the job done, but it had a lot of room for improvement.

Now, with more experience under my belt, I took a hard look at that first version and completely rebuilt the site to match modern standards, usability, and maintainability.

## What Was the Original Like?

The original site used Bootstrap 5 and had:

- A basic header with social links and branding.
- A large carousel hero section with yard sign photos.
- Content blocks like “Why Rent from Yard Art?” and “Proud to Offer” feature highlights.
- Separate carousels showcasing birthday, graduation, and business yard signs.
- A testimonials section with customer quotes.
- A footer with contact info and branding.

All the core pieces were there — but the site suffered from:

- **Repetitive and dense copy**: Several paragraphs repeated key info multiple times, making it overwhelming.
- **Inconsistent visual hierarchy**: Headings and paragraphs didn’t flow smoothly, making it harder for visitors to scan.
- **Fragmented carousels and galleries**: Multiple carousels on the same page created navigation complexity.
- **Basic responsiveness**: While Bootstrap was used, some layout choices limited the site’s mobile friendliness.
- **No centralized calls to action**: The “Call Today” phone number was present but lacked strategic placement or encouragement.
- **CSS styling issues**: Multiple classes for colors (e.g., “darkBlue,” “aqua,” “blue”) made it hard to maintain consistent branding.
- **Content organization**: The site felt more like a collection of sections rather than a guided customer journey.

## What Changed in the Redesign?

I rebuilt the site from the ground up with these goals:

- **Cleaner, leaner code:** Removed redundant markup and simplified the structure.
- **Focused messaging:** Rewrote copy to be concise, clear, and persuasive without repeating the same points.
- **Stronger calls to action:** Added visible buttons and repeated phone/contact info at natural breaks.
- **Unified styling:** Used Bootstrap utilities and a consistent color palette for easier maintenance and better branding.
- **Improved layout flow:** Arranged sections to guide visitors naturally from awareness to action.
- **Enhanced gallery experience:** Consolidated images into a single, user-friendly gallery with clear categories.
- **Added FAQ and trust elements:** Helped reduce customer friction and boost confidence.

## Why It Matters

This redesign isn’t just cosmetic. It transforms a “good enough” site into a polished tool that:

- Makes it easy for visitors to find what they want quickly.
- Builds trust through testimonials and transparent policies.
- Encourages users to take action without confusion.
- Supports future scalability and easier updates.

In short, it matches the professionalism and reliability of Yard Art as a business.

## Final Thoughts

If you’ve got an older site that’s doing the job but feels clunky or outdated, take a step back and ask:  
_Is it helping my business grow — or holding it back?_

Investing the time to clean up, rethink content, and modernize design pays off in happier visitors and more conversions. The Yard Art redesign is exactly that kind of win — a fresh start that respects the past but focuses on the future.
